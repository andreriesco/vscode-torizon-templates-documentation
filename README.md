# vscode-torizon-templates-documentation

Repository to store the media (images, videos, GIFs and so on) of the template specific documentations, which are on each template at `<template-folder>.doc/README.md` (for example, at `cppConsole.doc/README.md` for the `cppConsole` template), in the [vscode-torizon-templates](https://github.com/toradex/vscode-torizon-templates) Github repository.

If the media is specific of one template documentation, it should be on a folder with the same name as the one in the the [vscode-torizon-templates](https://github.com/toradex/vscode-torizon-templates) repository.

If the media is common for more than one template documentation, it should be on `common/<folder-with-intuitive-name>` (for example, at `common/python3` a video common to the Python 3 templates documentation).
